			<h1>Huexi's Blog</h1>
			<p>
				Developing skill through doing, guiltlessly exploring passion and interests, imbuing quality. Mindful that <em>everything around me is someoneâ€™s life work.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				I try to understand how the world works. I create things I want to exist in the world. I test those ideas against reality.
			</p>
			<p>
				In practice, this means most of my time is spent programming, investing, talking to 
				people and other creative work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of my work revolves around AI, Decentralized Finance, Intelligence Augmentation, Human Connection, User Experience & Memetics.
			</p>
			<p>
				It seems like the most impactful field right now is AI. Decentralized Finance, and new 
				ways of socializing/public perception is also getting quite interesting.
